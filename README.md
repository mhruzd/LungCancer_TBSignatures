# **Tuberculosis Incidence and Lung Cancer Biomarkers**

The data analysis compares three different time points:

1. Diagnosis
2. Two Months on Anti-TB Treatment
3. Six Months on Anti-TB Treatment

There are four specific biomarkers of interest:

1. TGF-Beta
2. PI3k-akt
3. p53
4. Wnt-Beta-Catenin

This RNA-seq data was from the paper “Transcriptional profiles predict treatment outcome in patients with tuberculosis and diabetes and at two weeks after initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment”
